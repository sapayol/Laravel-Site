				<h3>Returns</h3>
				<p>Because each leather jacket is made exclusively for you, <em>all sales are final</em>.</p>
				<p>We take extra care in discussing your measurements and any other questions with you before production to make sure you will be satisfied.</p>
				<p>The only exception to this rule is if your jacket deviates significantly from the measurements we agreed on. After we&rsquo;ve confirmed the issue with you, you can send us the unused jacket in the same condition that you received it. We will remake the jacket for free and pay for shipping.</p>
