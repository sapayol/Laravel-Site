		<h2>Vegetable tanned, chrome&#8208;free, full&#8208;grain leather</h2>
		<p>All our jackets are made with the most exclusive, vegetable tanned, full&#8208;grain leather. Itâ€™s supple, thick, has a warm touch, and a pleasant smell. With good care, it will not crack or bulge for decades but break in and develop a beautiful patina.</p>
		<p>Our leather is also absolutely free of the chromium salts that can become carcinogenic, found in almost every other leather garment.</p>
