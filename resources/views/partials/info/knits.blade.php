  <p>Our ribbings are made from one of the most eco-friendly yarns called Tencel, combined with a small amount of elastane to give it the right elasticity. Tencel fibers are extracted from wood and they feel like cotton, only softer, and they’re much more durable. The wristlets and waistbands have the classic double weave – a little looser on the top and tighter at the end.</p>
