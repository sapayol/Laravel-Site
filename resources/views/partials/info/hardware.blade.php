		<p class="image-caption">All zippers are YKK Excella. They combine legendary reliability with smooth elegance. Each tooth is individually polished, which gives the zipper a brilliant shine and prevents scratching of the jacket or your skin.

		<p class="image-caption">The buttons on our jackets are spring&#8208;type snaps from YKK, made purely out of nickel&#8208;free alloys. They receive the same beautiful coatings as our zippers and provide reliable closure without the need to pull too hard and damage the leather when you open them.</p>
