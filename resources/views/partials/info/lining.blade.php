		<h2>Silky, breathable lining</h2>
		<p>We chose a 100% Bemberg Cupro oxford weave for our lining. No other fabric breathes as well, absorbs and releases sweat as quickly, and is at the same time as smooth as silk. It’s the top lining choice of bespoke suit makers. All pockets are lined with a Tencel twill, a very strong, eco–friendly fabric that makes sure you don’t lose your keys.</p>
