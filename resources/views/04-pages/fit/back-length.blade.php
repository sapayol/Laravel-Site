	<h4>Start</h4>
	<p>Bend your head forward. The highest bone on the jacket-length of your neck that sticks out is your starting point.</p>
	<h4>End</h4>
	<p>If you’re wearing pants that sit right on your hips (not pants with a high waist), measure to end of the waistband. Anatomically, it’s right above the sacrum.</p>
	<p><em>Some people like a slightly shorter or longer jacket. You will be able to express your preference later. For n</em>ow, measure as indicated in the video.</p>
