	<h4>Start</h4>
	<p>Shoulder point (where you left off for the shoulder measurement)</p>
	<h4>End</h4>
	<p>Right at the wrist, just after the bone that sticks out a little on the side of your little finger (head of ulna).</p>
	<p><em>Go along the arm, passing through the elbow. Donâ€™t go straight from the shoulder to your hand.</em></p>
	<p>Some people like their sleeves a little longer, other a little shorter. You will be able to express your preference later. For now, measure as indicated in the video.</p>
