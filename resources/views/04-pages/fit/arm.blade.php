	<p>Start at the shoulder point (where you left off for the shoulder measurement).</p>
	<p>End right at the wrist, just after the bone that sticks out on the side of your little finger (head of ulna).</p>
	<p>Donâ€™t go straight from the shoulder to your hand. Go along the arm, passing through the elbow.</p>
	<p><em>Some people like their sleeves a little longer, others a little shorter. You will be able to express your preference later. For now, measure as indicated in the video</em>.</p>
